dcp_DME_arcite,SHIP,"An asymmetric drone bomber, firing salvoes of light missiles to overwhelm point defenses and clear the way for heavy strike craft. A smart-flare pack makes it marginally more survivable.",,,
dcp_DME_baikal,SHIP,"This heavy multi-role cruiser is an aging but flexible design, capable of handing nearly any requirement from convoy escort to fleet command ship to aggressive salvage operations in disputed zones. Once considered hopelessly obsolete, the current Block VI update features an all-new shield generator and improved high-output thrusters.",,,
dcp_DME_baikal_brone,SHIP,"This heavy multi-role cruiser is an aging but flexible design, capable of handing nearly any requirement from convoy escort to fleet command ship to aggressive salvage operations in disputed zones. The addition of a 'Brone V' composite armor package gives this older model improved staying power, at the cost of even worse handling, as well as an integral salvage gantry for recovery operations.",,,
dcp_DME_bantam,SHIP,"A compact and inexpensive drone fighter, armed with a gimballed electron bolter and protected by lightweight microbeam PD.",,,
dcp_DME_bbminerunner,SHIP,"An aggressive support frigate, designed to deliver minelaying and drone capabilities on a budget. Useful in small skirmishes, and a powerful addition to any frigate cloud.",,,
dcp_DME_bbsuperheavy,SHIP,"""...whatever it is, it doesn't look friendly. Did you see the size of those emplacements? Hey, it moved! I think it's starting to-""",- Combat recorder fragment,,
dcp_DME_blackhand,SHIP,"A densely-armored, well-shielded defensive frigate, poorly-armed but an effective support platform for three electron beam drones.",,,
dcp_DME_blacklancer,SHIP,"An AI-controlled support cruiser, intended to form the backbone of Blade Breaker forces. It lacks many of the core features of a crewed vessel, and devotes the saved internal space to greater firepower and drive capacity.",,,
dcp_DME_bladewood,SHIP,"A prototype fleet mothership, packing four fighter bays and a respectable level of support firepower into a durable armored hull. Massive internal flux sinks power both fighter autoforges and an advanced targeting core, resulting in a hybrid battlecarrier that can provide both devastating fire and fighter support from extreme ranges.",,,
dcp_DME_borzoi,SHIP,"A tough, agile phase ship, employing a high-pressure nodal phase cloak with extreme time-dilation. Many commanders consider them invaluable for reconnaisance and pursuit duty, but shy away from sending them into heavier combat.",,,
dcp_DME_bouclier,SHIP,"Durable, flexible, and increasingly rare since the initial production run finished, these heavily armored courier shuttles are nevetheless still seen around the sector from time to time.",,,
dcp_DME_burya,SHIP,"An unremarkable missile frigate, notable mostly for carrying outsized weapons on a small frame. Mainly used as a support craft, it finds frequent employment in tech-mining fleets as a convoy guard.",,,
dcp_DME_centaur,SHIP,"This chunky armed transport is the result of a long and exacting development process, aimed at designing the ultimate survivable cargo platform. Well armed and heavily shielded, the Lodestar is an excellent choice for shipping in high-intensity combat zones.",,,
dcp_DME_crasher,SHIP,"A unique and powerful artillery ship, equipped with a pair of devastating energy mortars. Relatively little of the hull concept has been developed further, but the weapons it mounts contributed to other, newer artillery systems.",,,
dcp_DME_curse,SHIP,"An otherwise unremarkable carrier... save for the advanced stealth coating applied over unusually heavy armor. The stealth-carrier concept never panned out for the sector navies, but it's perfectly suited to ambushes and terror strikes.",,,
dcp_DME_damselfly,SHIP,"Deploying a salvo of Perforator rockets, these tough bombers can inflict horrifying damage to enemy shipping from stand-off ranges.",,,
dcp_DME_dard,SHIP,"A cheap, lightweight drone fighter. Low-power weaponry and a small internal missile bay equips the Dard ideally for interception duty.

Atmospheric-capable drones have been a staple of land warfare forever; the Dard, adapted from these hardy and proven designs, goes a step further to become a highly capable swarm fighter.",,,
dcp_DME_demon,SHIP,"A simple, no-frills phase ship, developed from the test rig for an unusual hexagonal phase coil concept. It's a testament to how well the concept proved out that it's nearly the equal of dedicated close strike designs.",,,
dcp_DME_desertersupply_sm,SHIP,"An uncomplicated and efficient small cargo-handling platform, armed only with flares and a unique multi-beam emitter system.",,,
dcp_DME_desertersupply_lg,SHIP,"An uncomplicated and efficient medium cargo-handling platform, armed with flares, an interceptor bay, and a unique multi-beam emitter system.",,,
dcp_DME_devilray,SHIP,"A fearsome phase destroyer design, optimized for hit-and-run guerilla warfare. While no more of these ships have been produced in some time and maintenance requirements are steep, a rugged, modular design allows nonfunctional ships to be quickly cannibalized to keep the rest flying.",,,
dcp_DME_egret,SHIP,"The Aigrette is a dedicated space-superiority design that marries a durable chassis with advanced weapons to create an aggressive, predatory fighter capable of wiping the floor with other small craft.",,,
dcp_DME_feeder,SHIP,"Small mercenary groups often have a need for bare-bones carrier support, and the Feeder conversion of the Carabao hull has been a runaway success. It won't win any style awards, but budget-conscious United Securities commanders praise the Feeder's ability to repair and replenish fighters from a single, cramped internal bay.",,,
dcp_DME_firebeetle,SHIP,"A tough shielded fighter prototype, passed over in favor of more effective designs. A generous mix of weapons make it a fearsome brawler.",,,
dcp_DME_firespray,SHIP,"A durable light bomber, equipped with a small rack of plasma rockets for disabling weapons and engines. Repeat passes by multiple wings can leave even the hardiest ships crippled and drifting.",,,
dcp_DME_flare,SHIP,"An unremarkable heavy fighter design, employing missiles and an autogun to sweep down enemy fighters and pressure shielding. Keen-eyed observers will note their excellent handling.",,,
dcp_DME_flatmouse,SHIP,"A solid armored slab of a frigate, bristling with weapons and capable of providing extremely effective fire support to the marines it carries.",,,
dcp_DME_fletcher,SHIP,"An unremarkable light bomber, deploying a unique energy torpedo that's equally effective against both shields and armor.",,,
dcp_DME_focuser,SHIP,"A menacing bomber, equipped with a single Lens dimensional-implosion warhead and a powerful shield. Advanced pulse-jet drives allow for swift attack runs.",,,
dcp_DME_grand_union,SHIP,"Designed as much to project a public image of nobility and trust as for durability and firepower, these heavyweight destroyers were built to order for United Securities. Fleet commanders from the major naval forces look down on the lack of missile armament, though, and the frontal shield is a liability in large engagements.",,,
dcp_DME_guardian_turret,SHIP,"""...not large, at least, not the way we measure against stations - but it outmatches that tech-mining fleet, that's for sure... ...If anyone out there can hear me, we need backup! Any backup!""",- Combat recorder fragment,,
dcp_DME_gunpod,SHIP,"A powerful Blade Breaker turret drone with a heavy shield, a spinal Electron Bolt Projector, and generous defensive weaponry.",,,
dcp_DME_harridan,SHIP,"A fast, maneuverable fighter-bomber with EMP weaponry and a heavy missile armament. Enemy pilots are advised to treat Harridans with respect; short of heavy shielding, very few enemy fighters can withstand the missile barrage for long.",,,
dcp_DME_hellion,SHIP,"A brutal heavy fighter, armed with twin autocannon and fitted with a miniature phase cloak. Each fighter carries a point-defense beam as well, making them nearly immune to anti-fighter missiles.",,,
dcp_DME_hummingbird,SHIP,"A cheap, nimble interceptor. What it lacks in survivability or firepower it makes up for in agility, speed, and above all affordability.

Skeptical observers contend that even a good interceptor is a soft-skinned deathtrap, but the often desperate recruits who pilot these craft argue that even the toughest fighter gets hit, unless it can be where the shot isn't.",,,
dcp_DME_icax,SHIP,"An outgrowth of skipspace propulsion research, the Icax heavy fighter forgoes ordinary phase cloaking for high maneuverability and teleportation, producing a unique design optimized for suppression attacks.",,,
dcp_DME_ifrit,SHIP,"A failed prototype cruiser, intended as the core of a small, aggressive task force. Designed around reliable, previous-generation technologies and a maximally flexible weapons loadout, it failed to compete with the more radical Sparrowhawk and the design was shelved indefinitely.",,,
dcp_DME_imp,SHIP,"Derived from civilian racing drones, this daggerlike small craft is deployed en masse to overwhelm enemies. While it lacks the survivability of crewed frigates, it can be cheaply produced in volume.",,,
dcp_DME_iridium,SHIP,"A rough-and-tumble assault fighter, armed with heavy energy weapons and equipped with a robust shield generator.",,,
dcp_DME_jeannedarc,SHIP,"A heavy fleet carrier, designed to dominate the battlespace with high-capacity flight decks, top-of-the-line fire control systems and an impressive array of offensive and defensive weapons. The expense of constructing and maintaining such an enormous ship has, so far, kept them relatively rare.",,,
dcp_DME_kormoran,SHIP,"A new-model heavy cruiser design, oriented around high tactical speed and incredible frontal firepower. Careful layout of the secondary and tertiary batteries makes them difficult to flank.",,,
dcp_DME_leyte,SHIP,"While small carriers are typically conversions from freight craft, the d'Erlon was designed for escort duty from the ground up. Deficient missile-handling systems bar the type from mounting LRMs, but most captains prefer to take the d'Erlon into the thick of battle.",,,
dcp_DME_lightbomber,SHIP,"A large, armored bomber, deploying a heavy electron torpedo that's equally effective against both shields and armor.",,,
dcp_DME_lycosid,SHIP,"A nasty little interceptor designed to shred anything that gets close. A plasma decoy system distracts anti-fighter weaponry, allowing Lycosids to loiter around a target for extended periods.",,,
dcp_DME_maskirovka,SHIP,"A heavy phase destroyer, built around the nodal phase cloak and laid out to optimize short-range strike firepower. High top speed and superior handling make it especially valuable for pursuits and commerce raiding.",,,
dcp_DME_mindanao,SHIP,"Cut from the same cloth as the innovative Heron class, a more versatile slot layout and even greater deck capacity vaults this design into the role of carrier flagship in Dassault-Mikoyan fleets.",,,
dcp_DME_mystere,SHIP,"An older assault fighter model, reconfigured as a fighter-bomber with an upgraded weapons package. A smart flare launcher protects it from missile-armed interceptors.

A truly iconic fighter craft in the Southwestern core of the sector, one of the war-winning designs of Nikolaev's revolution. The durable basic spaceframe and modern, neither-fish-nor-fowl loadout of the Myst�re also make it an excellent trainer; most of the Nikolaev System Authority's ace fighter pilots learned their trade in these classic craft.",,,
dcp_DME_naja,SHIP,"While Dassault-Mikoyan is primarily known for producing civilian and armed-merchanter designs, this ugly frigate testifies to their prowess in crafting respectable combat craft. While not the equal of a Brawler in a stand-up fight, the Kobra is absurdly mobile and flexible, offering a shrewd captain many outfitting options.",,,
dcp_DME_naja_mk1,SHIP,"The first edition of the venerable Kobra hull, this ship is a museum piece now; lacking the high-end integrated PD weaponry and fully flexible slot layout, it's hopelessly outclassed by modern designs. The few still running are testament to the build quality of the original design, if not the good sense of their captains.",,,
dcp_DME_puddlejumper,SHIP,"A rugged light freighter, generously armed for its size. Many Puddle Jumper captains swear by their trusty craft... when they aren't swearing at them.",,,
dcp_DME_pup,SHIP,"An obsolete assault fighter, faithfully upgraded but now firmly behind the curve in speed and firepower. A tough frame and promiscuously available spares keep Pups flying in pirate and trade fleets around the sector.",,,
dcp_DME_rafale,SHIP,"A dependable shielded bomber wing, deploying the powerful Frappeur torpedo. A smart flare launcher and a layer of ablative armor make the Rafale I unusually survivable.",,,
dcp_DME_rafale2,SHIP,"A heavy shielded bomber wing, deploying proximity-fuzed Hedgehog cluster bombs en masse. Smart flare launchers and a layer of ablative armor make the Rafale II unusually survivable.",,,
dcp_DME_reef,SHIP,"A generic, even ordinary design, competitive with most light carriers found throughout the sector.

The Reef class is, like many prototypes, less a case of something going wrong than of not enough going right. While an excellent light carrier, it lacks the aggressive close-quarters focus typical of modern Blade Breaker vessels. The lack of engine stealth also makes them less useful in the sort of small-scale ambush scenarios where light carriers typically excel.",,,
dcp_DME_samoyed,SHIP,"When the Collapse hit the Nikolaev system, one of the first vessels Dassault-Mikoyan produced was this scrappy scout vessel, appropriately named for a loyal working animal. Now, Shalaikas are one of the company's most popular export designs, marrying a respectable cargo hold with powerful defenses.",,,
dcp_DME_sevastopol,SHIP,"An exceptionally durable vessel, produced in limited quantities as a better-protected alternative to the Tarsus. With superior fire arcs and a powerful, efficient shield, few freighter captains who own one would trade back.",,,
dcp_DME_skink,SHIP,"A lightweight, missile-armed interceptor. While by no means suitable for heavy combat, they can clear the battlespace of drones and other light craft efficiently.",,,
dcp_DME_slammer,SHIP,"A heavy line ship, angular and bristling with mounts for outsized weaponry. Echoes of this prototype are clearly visible in the current generation of Blade Breaker destroyers.",,,
dcp_DME_snakeeye,SHIP,"A durable heavy gunship, useful for providing light fire support or leading swarms of drone frigates. An efficient shield with wide coverage makes it highly survivable compared to most similar hulls.",,,
dcp_DME_snowgoose,SHIP,"While the Medusa set the standard for phase-skimming fast destroyers, this powerful prototype design is stiff competition. The Snow Goose is built around a tough, high-capacity flux frame with integrated point-defense beamers, allowing the ship to skip in and out of heavy fire-zones, intercepting multiple fighters or missiles simultaneously. A flexible turret layout allows the Snow Goose to focus on single targets or suppress swarms of smaller enemies with punishing, liquid firepower.",,,
dcp_DME_spearhead,SHIP,"An agile, heavily-armored hull that uses massive automation to minimize the crew area, allowing it to be packed to the gills with the ammunition stowage and power systems to support cruiser-scale firepower.",,,
dcp_DME_spooky,SHIP,"A devastating heavy gunship, designed to loiter around a target for extended periods and deliver high-volume, sustained fire.

While various proposals have been floated to use these tough, versatile craft in ground operations, they've shown relatively little utility against any but the most flimsy targets.",,,
dcp_DME_starsylph,SHIP,"These pricy luxury craft, while not the equal of a dedicated high-end combat frigate like the Tempest, have carved out a respectable niche for themselves as escort ships and secure couriers. Alas, the high sticker price has kept them out of the hands of many a sharp customer who could put a Star Sylph's more... exotic... features to good use.",,,
dcp_DME_stoat,SHIP,"True to their name, Husky frigates are tough and adaptable, and generous weapon arcs married to a powerful shield generator make them an excellent choice for protecting larger ships from bombers. A Goalkeeper drone provides area defense.",,,
dcp_DME_stoat_c,SHIP,"True to their name, Husky frigates are tough and adaptable, and generous weapon arcs married to a powerful shield generator make them an excellent choice for protecting larger ships from bombers. The Goalkeeper drone is swapped out for decoy flares on this customized export version.",,,
dcp_DME_stormkestrel,SHIP,"A powerful escort cruiser, designed around the need to operate for extended periods without resupply. Generous automation allows these ships to act as command nodes for task forces, while a flight deck enables them to project power across great distances.",,,
dcp_DME_tempestdrone,SHIP,"An advanced defensive drone, possibly the prototype for the Lycosid interceptor chassis. Mounting a SAM rack, a linear cannon, and a point-defense microgun on a compact, shielded frame, it supports the Tempest nicely.",,,
dcp_DME_BBtempest,SHIP,"An asymmetric, advanced design from the late Expansion Epoch, the Tempest-class is the quintessential attack frigate - fast, deadly and difficult to destroy.",,,
dcp_DME_tereshkova,SHIP,"Compact and efficient, the Tereshkova is a small survey vessel intended primarily for sale to the budget-conscious settlement authority or tech-mining firm. While in no sense competition for the venerable Apogee, these ships have a solid niche providing sensor management and fire support in smaller exploration fleets. The lack of a shield generator makes them second-line combatants at best.",,,
dcp_DME_thunderbolt,SHIP,"An outsized heavy fighter, designed around a pair of capacitor-driven laser units and an SRM turret. While slow, the inclusion of a frontal shield generator makes these clumsy craft more survivable than they first appear.",,,
dcp_DME_tonnerre,SHIP,"An agile missile cruiser, intended to provide long-range, highly mobile fire support. Like most similar ships, it's equipped with a missile autoforge, and can produce withering salvoes of bombardment missiles for extended periods of time.",,,
dcp_DME_tunguska,SHIP,"Designed to excel in small-scale skirmish combat, the Tunguska is a stiletto-shaped artillery destroyer with outsized firepower for its narrow frame. Larger engagements see Tunguskas relegated to the support role, sniping at cruisers and capital ships from behind a screen of picket ships.

Originally designed as a stop-gap hull to provide fire support for patrol fleets, the Tunguska's basic spaceframe has been upgraded into a fast hunter-killer over the years, most notably with the addition of higher-output engines; no other ship in the Dassault-Mikoyan arsenal is so well optimized for pursuit fighting and single-target damage.",,,
dcp_DME_vesper,SHIP,"A high-speed attack frigate with an absurdly versatile menu of fitting options. Vesper crews are reknowned for their recklessness and penchant for endless customization; a Vesper flown carefully or with stock parts would, after all, be a terrible waste of potential.",,,
dcp_DME_wanderer,SHIP,"These trim ships are tough, solid destroyer-class combatants, respected for their hardy internals and solid drive performance. A powerful focusing system makes them excellent platforms for beam weapons.",,,
dcp_DME_warlock,SHIP,"An impressively built battlecarrier, lightly-armed but with considerable area defenses. A heavy LRM launcher rounds out the design.",,,
dcp_DME_zelenograd,SHIP,"A hulking survey ship, built immediately post-Collapse to spearhead aggressive tech mining and exploration efforts. Over the years, the various iterations of the Zelenograd have been up-armored and refitted with heavier and heavier weapons packages to deal with claim-jumpers and raiders, until the final product is more of a pocket dreadnought than a large science vessel.

While the current Block XI Zelenograd is fairly described as more warship than explorer, it retains an impressive capability for long-range, independent operations with minimal trailing support craft. No few of the current small salvage and tech-mining firms would be delighted to compact their cumbersome, aging scavenger fleets and vulnerable tankers into nimble, purposeful expeditions spearheaded by a Zelenograd.",,,
dcp_DME_vesper_p,SHIP,"An unusual combination of backdoor dealings, political interplay and plain hubris delivered the blueprints for this advanced vessel to a willing rogue industrial conglomerate. Albeit lacking key technologies and manufacturing know-how, the design was nonetheless made flightworthy by assembling what was available and replacing the rest with stock components. 

While in appearance similar to the original, this frigate lacks its versatility and is best suited for the roles of long range support and assault on larger and slower vessels, not unlike the missile corvettes of old. ",,,

dcp_DME_zonedefbit,SHIP,A lightly armed defense drone with a low refit time.,,,
dcp_DME_funnel,SHIP,"A light offensive drone, often installed on Dassault-Mikoyan ships as a support weapon.",,,
dcp_DME_goalkeeper,SHIP,An agile CIWS drone with a shield and generous light weaponry.,,,
,,,,,
dcp_DME_3x4cmrailgun,WEAPON,"A short-ranged, salvo-firing double rail accelerator.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_6cmrailgun,WEAPON,"An advanced shield-suppression weapon, trading rate of fire for punishing damage and accuracy. The extremely high velocity of each shot lends it limited armor-piercing ability as well.

Railguns are some of the oldest and most well-explored spaceborne weapons, having been recorded as in use during the pre-FTL conflicts in humanity's original solar system. This advanced version is notable for firing an especially small projectile at such high speeds that it forms a bright trail of vaporized armature material.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_9cmrailgun,WEAPON,"A salvo-firing hypervelocity weapon, firing a three-round burst of powerful slugs for mid-range brawling. Accuracy and range both suffer, of course.

Designed and built specifically for the Sixth Bureau's fleets to exacting specifications, these burst-capable rail accelerators are rare and coveted; a few proposals to mount them on land-skimming hover vehicles might see them become more common.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_12cmrailgun,WEAPON,"A hypervelocity shield-busting weapon, firing accurate, powerful slugs at impressive range. The only drawback is a low fire rate, making it less effective against small, fast targets.

Larger and more effective than the primitive hypervelocity driver favored by Domain engineers and doctrine, the Dassault-Mikoyan heavy rail accelerator was designed to deliver a greater kinetic impact using a smaller, much faster projectile. This was regarded as optimal for breaking shields at range with salvoes from multiple mounts, rather than plinking away with one or two.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_20cmrailgun,WEAPON,"An enormous, high-powered kinetic weapon, hurling devastating electromagnetic thunderbolts against enemy shields. An unimpressive rate of fire and ponderous turn speed put this weapon firmly in the anti-capital niche.

A failed competitor to the Domain-standard Gauss Cannon, and largely overshadowed by it in most respects. Salvoes of slugs from multiple mounts on stations are deadly to most small and medium-sized ships.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_amm_ftr,WEAPON,"This simple, compact unit launches and fires Itano AMMs in bursts of three rounds. Low ammunition capacity is offset by an autoloader, allowing sustained, if slow, fire during long engagements.",Anti-Fighter,,
dcp_DME_amm_samo,WEAPON,"This simple, compact unit launches and fires Itano AMMs in bursts of three rounds. Low ammunition capacity is offset by an autoloader, allowing sustained, if slow, fire during long engagements.",Anti-Fighter,,
dcp_DME_ammlight,WEAPON,"This simple, compact unit launches and fires Itano AMMs in bursts of six rounds, saturating point-defenses and overwhelming fighters. Accurate mesotronic guidance makes them difficult to evade.",Anti-Fighter,,
dcp_DME_ammpod,WEAPON,"This simple, compact unit launches and fires Itano AMMs in bursts of eight rounds, saturating point-defenses and overwhelming fighters. Accurate mesotronic guidance makes them difficult to evade.",Anti-Fighter,,
dcp_DME_AMMblistertube,WEAPON,"A launch system for the multi-warhead Tomino AMM, built-in on the Borzoi phase frigate as a means of ensuring area control by flooding the battlespace with Itano missiles. Because of the tendency for the system to completely overwhelm point defenses, Borzoi pilots often refer to the missile trigger as the 'kill 'em all' button.",Point Defense,,
dcp_DME_autohybridblaster,WEAPON,"A terrifying rapid-fire hybrid blaster, designed to pound shields and melt armor with a barrage of white-hot positron bolts.

Even with a superconducting cooling system, this weapon is built around a capacitor system designed to carefully regulate the fire rate, lest a poorly-contained packet slag the entire positon accelerator unit.",Assault,,
dcp_DME_autolaser,WEAPON,"A rapid-firing multiple laser mount designed for mid-range suppression of small and medium combatants. Compared to standard pulse lasers, armor damage is deficient, but rapid fire and high bolt speed improve performance against shields.",Assault,,
dcp_DME_autolaser_ftr,WEAPON,A rapid-firing multiple laser mount designed for mid-range suppression of small and medium combatants.,Assault,,
dcp_DME_autolaser_small,WEAPON,"A trio of light lasers mounted in a common housing, ideal for suppressing enemy shields and fighter craft. High bolt speed makes these weapons a perfect fit against faster, shielded enemies.",Assault,,
dcp_DME_autolaser_smallftr,WEAPON,"A light laser mounted in a compact housing, ideal for suppressing enemy shields and fighter craft.",Assault,,
dcp_DME_basilisk,WEAPON,"A monstrous high-powered shockbeam, capable of devastating strikes. Imperfections in hull armor have a tendency to fail explosively as the intense beam passes over them.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_blazedriver,WEAPON,"A heavy repeating blaster, projecting a steady stream of fast, inaccurate anti-armor bolts at medium range.

Because of the small, but significant, core physical component of the blaze weapon's bolts, it uses ammunition-cycling equipment similar to a light machine gun.",Assault,,
dcp_DME_blazegun,WEAPON,"A light repeating blaster, projecting a rapid stream of fast, inaccurate anti-armor bolts at medium range.",Assault,,
dcp_DME_buzzgun,WEAPON,"Even more pathetic than its twin-mounted cousin, this single-barreled buzz gun is the point defense weapon of last resort.",Point Defense,,
dcp_DME_chasseurLRMlauncher,WEAPON,"A fearsome multiple-warhead kinetic support missile, used to disrupt enemy formations at range and spike shields.

While Chasseurs will never be common, many skeptical captains have warmed up to the weapon for close support use; unlike the Squall, the cloud of Voltigeur submunitions arrive closely-spaced if not simultaneously, and the launching ship can retreat immediately after the missile is fired.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_clusterlauncher,WEAPON,"A long-range cluster munition, deploying concussive EMP bomblets to soften up enemy formations from a distance. Due to the size of the ammunition, the autoloader can falter in long engagements.

Rumor has it this weapon was originally developed with an eye to destroying shieldless enemies by surprise, though whether this means civilian shuttles in dock, or Domain autodefenses, no one beyond the design team knows for sure.",Fire Support,,
dcp_DME_electronrocket,WEAPON,"An unguided torpedo carrying an electron-compression warhead, equally effective against shields and armor. Penetration is relatively low, but hull hits cause a devastating arc surge that disables multiple weapons and engines.

Semi-inert warheads have been the dream of strike munitions designers for milennia - the advanced electron-compression device at the heart of this system is as close as any of them are likely to get. The end result is a more compact warhead than most torpedoes, with fewer handling problems.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_electronrocket_rack,WEAPON,"An pair of unguided torpedoes carrying electron-compression warheads, equally effective against shields and armor. Penetration is relatively low, but hull hits cause a devastating arc surge that disables multiple weapons and engines.

Semi-inert warheads have been the dream of strike munitions designers for milennia - the advanced electron-compression device at the heart of this system is as close as any of them are likely to get. The end result is a more compact warhead than most torpedoes, with fewer handling problems, and the possibility of twin mountings like this.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_electronrocket_pod,WEAPON,"A launcher for unguided torpedoes carrying electron-compression warheads, equally effective against shields and armor. Penetration is relatively low, but hull hits cause a devastating arc surge that disables multiple weapons and engines.

Semi-inert warheads have been the dream of strike munitions designers for milennia - the advanced electron-compression device at the heart of this system is as close as any of them are likely to get. Because the warheads are compact and nearly impossible to detonate by accident, the launcher is both unusually small, and carries a larger than average magazine.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_erpulsebeam,WEAPON,"A long-range combat laser; an advanced, but unremarkable design, effective against fighters and unshielded ships. Damage falls off with range.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_fragtorp_ftr,WEAPON,"A multiple-launch pack for Streak submunitions. Useful against small, fast targets and ships with damaged armor.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_fragtorp_rack,WEAPON,"A twin rack for the Streak multi-warhead MRM. Useful against small, fast targets and ships with damaged armor.",Strike,,

dcp_DME_gravmissilelauncher,WEAPON,Advanced EMP/fragmentation missile launcher capable of rapid fire. Ample internal magazines. ,Fire Support,,
dcp_DME_gravmissiletube,WEAPON,Advanced EMP/fragmentation missile tube capable of rapid fire. Small internal magazine.,Fire Support,,
dcp_DME_heavylrpd,WEAPON,"A powerful combat laser, capable of ruinous damage. To minimize damage to the mount, it's fired only in short bursts. Damage falls off with range.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_hedgehog_bay,WEAPON,"Launches a brief salvo of proximity-fuzed explosive bombs. Due to the low velocity of the bombs, it's difficult to score reliable hits on moving targets.",Fire Support,,
dcp_DME_hedgehog_pod,WEAPON,"Launches a 12-round salvo of proximity-fuzed explosive bombs. Due to the low velocity of the bombs, this weapon is typically mounted only by capital ships and stations.

Until recently, the Hedgehog system was seen as a weapon without a mission by most Dassault-Mikoyan strategists. The dominant paradigm of countering fighters with fighters of one's own left little room for an area-defense weapon that worked best on slow or stationary platforms, already disfavored by the dominant cruiser-warfare doctrine. Fortunately, the inevitable need for stationary defenses rescued the design concept from the scrapheap, and in a twist of fate, some attack groups have begun experimenting with Hedgehog pods in forward offensive roles, where fast frigates act as large bombers against enemy capital ships.",Fire Support,,
dcp_DME_hellhoundlauncher,WEAPON,"If ordinary Hellriders were bad, this magazine-fed launcher unit is worse. Holding twelve rounds, it can pump out the hellish blue thunderbolts fast enough to devastate all but the heaviest shields and armor.

Tube-launched Hellrider missiles had to overcome a variety of teething problems to reach the market; the consequences of a missile jamming in the loading mechanism were more than a little daunting for Dassault-Mikoyan engineers. The final design places a high premium on safety; accidental detonation of the projectile's metallic helium warhead is vanishingly unlikely, although aftermarket tinkerers continue to blow themselves up trying to improve on the design.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_hellhound,WEAPON,"Mad, bad, and dangerous to know, the Hellrider missile marries a high-yield metastable warhead to a devilishly fast drive unit and excellent guidance. This twin rack is the most common mounting.

Hellrider pursuit missiles were one of the first commercially successful Dassault-Mikoyan weapon designs to reach the sector; while neither as promiscuously available as the Harpoon, nor quite as powerful as the Atropos, the high average hit rate speaks for itself - a Hellrider will follow a target through almost any evasive maneuver a living crew can survive, and has the speed to catch anything that can't teleport out of the way.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_hellhound_single,WEAPON,"Mad, bad, and dangerous to know, the Hellrider missile marries a high-yield metastable warhead to a devilishly fast drive unit and excellent guidance. This single unit is a common mounting.

Hellrider pursuit missiles were one of the first commercially successful Dassault-Mikoyan weapon designs to reach the sector; while neither as promiscuously available as the Harpoon, nor quite as powerful as the Atropos, the high average hit rate speaks for itself - a Hellrider will follow a target through almost any evasive maneuver a living crew can survive, and has the speed to catch anything that can't teleport out of the way.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_hellspear_sp,WEAPON,"A modified Hellspear cannon, firing experimental shells with a higher projectile velocity, greater accuracy, and increased rate of fire.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_hellspear,WEAPON,"A gigantic electrothermal sniper weapon, designed to punch through heavy armor at long range with unique explosive-rod ammunition.

As with similar weapons, the Hellspear's advantage over comparable heavy armor-piercers is the high velocity of its shots; Hellspear crews can engage targets at the outer edge of the weapon's range with a surprising hit rate. Some gun commanders use the weapon as an immense sniper rifle, hunting the battlespace for targets of opportunity from a distance.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_howler,WEAPON,"This electrothermal smoothbore gun is ideal for breaching armor, but suffers from a low rate of fire due to a complex loading mechanism for the unique explosive-rod ammunition.

'Remarkable for being totally unremarkable' sums up the Howler. The only notable design feature is the open-cycle cooling system, which allows the gun to use higher-energy propellants, and achieve correspondingly higher muzzle velocities, than would otherwise be the case.",Strike,,
dcp_DME_hybridblaster,WEAPON,"A supercharged pulse laser unit married to a blaster-type positron accelerator produces this fearsome energy weapon, which combines excellent armor penetration with a comparatively high rate of fire.

Hybrid weaponry is a signature product of the Dassault-Mikoyan military line, and jealously guarded against export sales and competition. Tinkering with unlicensed hybrid weapons is an excellent way to blow yourself into constituent atoms; either by carelessly breaching the positron containment unit's shielding, or by disabling some vital piece of flux-regulating equipment.",Assault,,

dcp_DME_impaler,WEAPON,"An unremarkable point-defense laser. Compared to the standard PD Laser, it has longer range, but poorer flux efficiency. Some crews have been known to tinker with these hardy mounts, setting them to preferentially target ships and fighters when in range.",Point Defense,,
dcp_DME_impaler_rapid,WEAPON,"A lightweight combat laser; excellent against fighters and light craft, but poor against enemy shields. Damage falls off with range.",Assault,,
dcp_DME_impulsor,WEAPON,"A compact point-defense mount, closely integrated into the hull. The low-power stream of particles often confuses missile guidance and stabilization systems, but penetration is extremely poor; the targeting AI excludes fighters and ships by design.",Point Defense,,
dcp_DME_ionbeamer,WEAPON,"A spinoff of shockbeam emitter technology, this anti-shield weapon trades continuous fire for a wicked strobing pulse that lances a target's shields with a high-speed stream of excited gravitons. As a bonus, it has some secondary electrical effects.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_linearcannonlight,WEAPON,"A five-barreled rotary magnetic accelerator, firing long bursts to overwhelm enemy shields. Ideal for close-range, hit-and-run suppression of shielded ships.

Fitted as standard to many civilian ships, these durable weapons often turn up in the defensive arsenals of planetary militias looking for a support weapon against shielded ground-skimmers.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_heavylinear_autogun,WEAPON,"A seven-barreled rotary magnetic accelerator, firing extended bursts to overwhelm enemy shields. Ideal for close-range, hit-and-run suppression of shielded ships, and especially handy on patrol frigates.

A perennial favorite in numerous mounts, these handy weapons have sometimes been mounted on armored rovers and fixed emplacements to destroy shielded ground vehicles. While the individual slugs are weak, they devastate shield generators, and sustained fire with an extended ammunition feed can saw through light armor given time.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_linearcannon,WEAPON,"A magnetic accelerator gun in a proven housing, excellent for shield suppression but hampered by poor performance against armor.

While magnetic weapons are hardly unknown in the Sector, issues of barrel wear and complex electrical switching have prevented most from reaching their full potential. The use of sophisticated non-ferrous materials has made the Dassault-Mikoyan version vastly more practical in service, though not meaningfully less expensive.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_linearcannonheavy,WEAPON,"Enormous paired magnetic accelerators in a robust oscillating turret, firing heavy slugs at high velocity.",Assault,,
dcp_DME_linearcannontwin,WEAPON,"A pair of magnetic accelerator guns in a powered mount, ideal for mid-range suppression of enemy shielding. Due to heating concerns, multiple mounts are preferred for maintaining a sustained barrage of fire.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_linearflak_single,WEAPON,"Faster-firing than ordinary flak guns, this defensive turret will handily swat missiles and most fighters with scattering bursts of proximity-fused shells.

The smart-fuze technology used in these weapons is nothing short of remarkable; each projectile in the five-round cartridge carries an integrated collision and target sensor, allowing it to discriminate between target types and choose the optimal detonation pattern. For missiles, a proximity-fuzed fragmenting explosion; for ships and fighters, a dynamic shaped charge that can punch through light armor.",Point Defense,,
dcp_DME_linearflak,WEAPON,"A rapid-fire twin-mounted flak weapon, firing scattering bursts of proximity-fused shells. Deadly to missiles and fighters.

Typically found as an integral mount, the various attempts to market it as a modular option have failed due to the short range and negligible armor penetration.",Close Support,,
dcp_DME_magpulser,WEAPON,"A flexible ionizing weapon, designed for anti-fighter defense. Damage is low, but just a few solid hits will disable turrets and engines.

Widely considered superior to the standard Ion Cannon, hybrid pulsers fire more rapidly and deliver more of their energy packet as penetrating damage rather than ionization. The effects on exposed flesh are not pretty.",Assault,,

dcp_DME_marteau_esm_barrage,WEAPON,"Launches a large salvo of 'Extended Sprint Attack Drive' missiles with low-yield warheads. Useful for pressuring shields, stripping light armor and finishing enemies.

While the Jongleur missile is typically found in smaller mountings, this heavy barrage-fire mount remains in inventory as a long-range support weapon. Repeated salvoes are dangerous even to capital ships; sheer volume makes up for low damage, and the long-lived missiles remain dangerous, returning for repeat passes if they miss the target.",Assault,,

dcp_DME_NTKcannon,WEAPON,"An unremarkable anti-armor weapon with a decent rate of fire, loaded with unique explosive-rod ammunition.

The Horn is widely regarded as a slow but highly effective brawling weapon by pilots familiar with Dassault-Mikoyan hardware; penetration is excellent, and just one or two mixed into a battery of kinetics will quickly shred light armor.",Close Support,,

dcp_DME_perforatorpod,WEAPON,"The larger version of the reliable Perforator rocket pod, this high-capacity assault mount feeds pre-fused rockets from a 12-round ready magazine, allowing it to deliver devastating barrages to a target.

Appropriately for a weapon adapted from venerable ground-based artillery rockets, the Katyusha Perforator is also considered a staple weapon in the Land Forces of the Nikolaev System Authority. Lavish use of artillery has long been a staple feature of the Authority's brief planetary campaigns; Peremohy's small population can ill-afford human losses.",Strike,,

dcp_DME_shockartillery,WEAPON,"A heavy, long-range blaster, firing slow-moving bolts that detonate on impact with enemy ships. Though it's slow and inaccurate, this weapon is highly effective at providing area fire support.

The 75mm gain-medium pellets for these fearsome weapons are unusually delicate and therefore slow to load, but many carrier and support cruiser captains prefer them to railguns or beam weaponry for their punishing raw damage output. Close detonations are equally ruinous to armor and shields, often fusing circuitry and melting exposed optical pickups in the bargain.",Fire Support,,

Internal dividers are few and far between; parkways and elevated gardens break up the bright ceramic surfaces of the station�s wide, spacious interior.

Everything is a little too clean, too regulated, but for all that, the people living here seem genuinely happy. Security is tight, but unobtrusive, even in the much-maligned financial district, and the tourist decks boast some truly impressive fine dining options.",

There's a thriving black market here, much to the embarassment of everyone.",
novymir_starforge,CUSTOM,"A small industrial outpost, producing antimatter fuel, raw metals, and exotic ceramics destined for Dassault-Mikoyan factories in the Nikolaev system. Occasional aid to the beleaguered world of Valjean is coordinated through here, in addition to sporadic tech-mining expeditions and anti-piracy patrols.

As a strategic fuelling outpost, Novy Mir Starforge would ordinarily rate a fleet base, but given the absence of organized pirate gangs and nearby hostile powers, the garrison has been reduced to a token presence.",,"Fuel production and ore smelting are tedious business at the best of times, and the nightlife on Novy Mir is appropriately raucous as a result. The station�s commercial decks have a startling variety of bars, sleepovers, food stalls, and service outlets, offering myriad routes into trouble or out of it, subject only to the limitations of taste, local law, and ready credits.

While most of the station is tightly secured, several disused maintenance corridors have become semi-permanent shelters for a small number of itinerant refugees; their numbers remain steady despite a constant churn of half-hearted security sweeps and petty disputes ending in stabbings - or worse. Station government is content to keep a lid on the violence, so long as no shareholders are involved.",

No doubt for good reason, as well, and what that reason is should keep your crew on their toes.",
station_brightheaven,CUSTOM,"A destroyed sporeship, eking out a second life as a meeting place and transshipment point for various goods, legal... or otherwise.",,"The eerie, empty corridors of Brightheaven loom large in the folklore of Nikolaev's pirate gangs; something about empty, decaying colony ships seems to give even the most hardened vac-rat the willies. The people here speak in whispers and do business furitively, even by the standards of pirate outposts. The lack of any central authority or unified maintenance planning only adds to the chaos.",
station_antilles,CUSTOM,"A mining station fallen on hard times, the arrival of a Dassault-Mikoyan industrial outpost in Martinique did nothing to improve Antilles Starport's on-and-off economic troubles; the station's government was soon replaced by one more welcoming to businessmen with 'creative' notions of potential new revenue streams. Several cycles ago, a group of private investors hired mercenaries to clear it out; no pirates have returned... yet.",,"The airless corridors of Antilles Starport are pocked with burn holes and broad, reddish-brown stains; it doesn't take much imagination to conjure up images of the slaughter that took place here. Most of the pirates likely died of decompression when the ring was breached; the remainder must have been hunted through the wreckage for days before their luck, or air, ran out.",
station_mariegalante,CUSTOM,"This small station served as an orbital terminal for the planet below. Unable to cope with the flow of refugees, it collapsed into anarchy and then total destruction, as rioters destroyed systems and ultimately, depressurized the passenger galleries. Now, it orbits Marie-Galante as a silent tomb, airless corridors choked with the bodies of the fleeing dead.",,"Some of the interior devastation has been cleaned up by rescue workers and scavenger crews with sudden attacks of conscience, but here and there scenes of raw, unrestrained savagery and its aftermath remain, preserved eerily well by vacuum. The less said about the sight of, say, a flash-frozen spray of bodily fluids, the better.",
station_meridian,CUSTOM,"Once a promising freeport straddling the sector's Western trade routes out of Magec, Meridian Station's swift fall into the hands of pirates associated with the Kanta Cartel was a massive blow to the economy of the Kostroma system.",,"Pirate stations aren't known for their restrained, sober local atmospheres, and Meridian Station is worse than most, with a nightlife to rival any red-light district, freak show, or abattoir. The notorious Combat Zone of the outer commercial ring lives up to its name; don't go in there for a drink unless you're heavily armed.

The line between radical political party, terrorist cell, and pirate band is blurry in the extreme on Meridian Station; it's a big, wealthy, unregulated center for all the Sector's most unlawful, immoral, unsavory, and fattening trades, and anyone who stays here by choice at least dabbles in most of them. Expect to dodge at least a dozen thoroughly repugnant propositions before breakfast, business and pleasure both, and best to drink anything you're offered with someone else's mouth.",

The only remaining markers of human habitation are discarded ration wrappers and some truly disgusting propositions burned into the plating with hand weaponry.,
station_lareole_polis,CUSTOM,"A busy, but unstable commercial starport, swollen with an influx of refugees from the fall of Marie-Galante. A sizeable military presence is based here, aimed at deterring pirate attacks launched from the anarchic inner system.

Debates rage on Peremohy about the costs and benefits of the fleets stationed here, but a slim majority in favor of continued humanitarian relief and anti-piracy patrol has thus far won out.",,"Though no imminent danger of collapse remains, La Reole Polis has been strained beyond design capacity for a generation by the ongoing demographic disasters of the inner system. The station's permanent quarantine section - or 'Q' - has an unsavory reputation in humanitarian circles; persistent rumors of wide-spread corruption and abuse of emergency powers circulate, and riots are a regular occurance.

In spite of the gruesome catastrophes that dominate the recent history of the Kostroma system, La Reole Polis is still a cosmopolitan and wealthy port by Persean Sector standards; you can find drinks with real fruit mixers in the dockside bars, and something close to the fine cuisine of Earth is available, albeit at steep prices and with a heavy emphasis on fish, more fish, and fish-like native marine life, on the more rarefied commercial decks.",

Shoals of small craft flit around it, engaged in repairs or other inscrutable activity.",,"If anything, this fortress-port is even more imposing closer up; an architecture designed to intimidate on every level, right down to the arrow-slit docking ports and massive armored stationkeeping thrusters. Several laser targeting systems casually paint your hull, and massive weapons emplacements swivel side to side in automated testing routines.

'Evil' is a strong word to apply - nevertheless, a palpable air of menace is projected from everything you see. Outsiders are profoundly unwelcome here, and their toleration is purely a matter of short-term convenience.",
planet_lareole,CUSTOM,"A glittering, beautiful water planet, once apparently destined to become one of the great tourist attractions of the Domain's newest frontier. But the angel of history had other plans; the golden beaches lie fallow, and the seas are farmed intensively to provide enough food for the crowded station above.",,"For every scenic island, a half-dozen sprawling kelp farms and fish hatcheries mar the surface of the ocean; relatively little development has touched La Reole�s scarce landmasses. The notable exceptions are lit up so garishly that they could be mistaken for bursts of energy-weapons fire.

The various fishing settlements and refugee-camps-turned-towns have an unrestrained, joyous nightlife, full of noisy music and drinks you'll regret. People have carved out new homes for themselves here thousands of times over; they avoid last names and any discussion of the personal past by long reflex. Now and again, you can see lone figures gazing insystem, but to what, you'll never know.",
planet_aleph1,CUSTOM,"An ordinary volcanic world, remarkable largely for the poverty of its mineral resources.",,,
planet_aleph2,CUSTOM,"A terran-extreme variant world with a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere maintained by a relatively subdued biosphere that exists largely within the oceans that undergo periodic thaw periods. The surface is very cold indeed, but it is human-viable if precautions are observed. Carbon dioxide may freeze out of the atmosphere at the poles during the local winter.",,"From close orbit, you can see that there's been a concerted effort to disguise the recently-abandoned habitation of this world. Extensive tunneling and underground settlement seem to have taken place, all with an eye towards maximum possible concealment. The question is - who hid here? From what?",
planet_astalon,CUSTOM,"A choking, sulphurous rock, settled to exploit the incredible biological and chemical potential of a unique, if horribly dangerous, biosphere. Astalon's organic wealth allowed it to weather the Collapse, somewhat, albeit with a drastically reduced population. Now, it's a weak independent world, calling on Kazeron's fleets to protect it, but spurning full League membership.",,"An industrial powerhouse fallen on hard times, Astalon nevertheless stubbornly clings to viability thanks to rich, if terribly crude, chemical industries. The remaining inhabitants of this world are fiercely proud of their cramped settlements. Rumors persist that some of the outlying domes trade with pirates, but thus far, no one has caught them in the act.",
planet_mariegalante,CUSTOM,"An eccentric jungle world swathed in steam and verdant, aggressive foliage, Marie-Galante was always a marginal colony world, but managed to weather the Collapse more or less intact. A series of weak, unstable governments were then finally toppled by an ambitious pirate warlord, whose brief rise and bloody fall set the stage for the current, vicious anarchy. The unusually violent weather system did the rest; the surviving population is little more than scattered, heavily-armed bands, constantly at odds with one another.",,"Even from orbit, the signs of intermittent surface warfare are starkly visible through Marie-Galante's turbulent atmosphere. Artillery rockets and pulse-carbine fire draw thin, bright streaks through the jungle, punctuated by explosions.

Marie-Galante's various ethnic groups and political alignments were once organized into a number of competing blocs, but after several generations of vicious fighting, decaying infrastructure and a hostile biosphere, allegiance is governed solely by an extreme form of resource-driven realpolitik; groupings form, cooperate, and splinter in cold-blooded fashion based on their calculated chances of surviving another cycle of the unforgiving surface conditions.",
planet_peremohy,CUSTOM,"A dry, eccentric world, made nearly Terran by intensive infrastructure projects directed from the orbiting station. Unusually for such a promising colony, the planet is thinly-settled; the spacefaring focus of Peremohy's culture draws the best and brightest up to Peremohy Highport.",,"Once a sleepy frontier world under the grip of the vicious autocrat Mikhail IX, Peremohy was liberated by the Nikolaev Revolutionary Council with Dassault-Mikoyan backing. Now, the Nikolaev System Authority forms a symbiotic relationship with The Company, as they call it (not without affection); providing administrative muscle and governmental legitimacy to the ruthless aerospace firm.",
planet_tenacity,CUSTOM,"A cold, forbidding Luddic world, Tenacity is reknowned for harsh winters and brief, explosive summers. The local flavor of Luddic faith is unusually tolerant and ecumenical, no doubt influenced by the utter neccessity of the mirror system that keeps Tenacity from falling back into the deep-freeze that Domain engineers once thawed it from, and the off-world specialists who perform periodic repairs.",,"Although the collapse of the system economy devastated Tenacity's offworld trade, there simply wasn't enough of it to do much damage; belts were tightened, rationing implemented, and the planet pulled through. Some, though certainly not all, of the refugees from the inner system have integrated well; the Luddi are no strangers to pilgrimages, willing or otherwise.",
planet_valjean,CUSTOM,"A dry, partially-terraformed planet perpetually on the verge of League membership, Valjean's biosphere failed catastrophically after the Collapse.

Even from a distance, it's possible to make out ruins and other signs of human habitation on the surface.",,"From near orbit, you can see even more of the settlements and rail lines crisscrossing theprincipal continent. This world wasn't just settled; it was developing. So where did they go?",
planet_cayenne,CUSTOM,"The once-cosmopolitan moon of Marie-Galante, Cayenne is now a frozen, airless tomb, the great city-domes cracked in the same spasms of violence that destroyed the last vestiges of stability on the world below.",,"From orbit, you can see a few sputtering lights and makeshift shelters, but the air-defense systems painting your ship with low-power lasers suggest that no one is welcoming visitors.",

Whatever natural resources it might hold are locked up beneath many meters of cruel ice.",,Davout's surface is even less appealing from close orbit; nothing remotely resembling life could survive down there... could it?,
planet_etincelle,CUSTOM,"A geologically active world, perilously close to Nikolaev's intense corona, offering up magnificent vistas of churning lava and exotic shimmering slag from low orbit. Even a cursory scan reveals great, but inaccessible riches; a hostile promise of vast mineral wealth, or certain death, to the explorer who sets down here.",,"Visible from orbit, the half-melted ruins of a Domain exploratory camp testify amply to the hazards of setting down on this world. After two centuries, much of the original structure has been plowed under by lava flows, but the distinctive lines of Domain-standard architecture are unmistakable.",
planet_gironde,CUSTOM,"Dominating the outer system, Gironde's imposing bulk is a splendid sight in La Reole's night sky. A few itinerant gas miners plumb the upper depths for volatiles, but rarely become rich, or break even; Gironde is as commercially useless as it is aesthetic.",,"Close up, it's possible to just make out the tourist barges as they slide lazily across Gironde's vast and beautiful face. Smaller, less brilliant specks denote the desperate souls who strike out as wildcat miners, hoping to scoop enough to afford a small ship or passage outsystem. Most simply trade a slow death for a quick one; Gironde's upper atmosphere is lethally unpredictable.",
planet_javert,CUSTOM,"Unusually harsh even by the standards of cryovolcanic worlds, this windy, desolate iceball has little to recommend it, besides the potential wealth of volatiles locked up beneath its unforgiving surface.",,"Javert has been host to several ill-fated volatile extraction schemes. Now, the silent remains of those attempts to carve a living out of the permafrost stand as mute reminders of human folly.",
planet_juliette,CUSTOM,"A tiny, almost invisible rock, nestled in Stendhal's L4 trojan asteroids. Space debris and derelict ships collect here - some valuable, some not.",,,
planet_laureline,CUSTOM,"A steam-wreathed jungle planet, harboring extensive ruins visible from even high orbit. The vigorous, adaptable jungle roils constantly, a seething mass of green supercharged by intense solar radation.",,"Close up, this was always destined to be a nightmare world; hostile surface life got a boost from tailored mutagens when Laureline was seeded by a rogue sporeship, filling the planet with aggressive, predatory insects and kilometer-long swimming lizards.

In the end, however, human beings did for themselves what the jungle was never, quite, able to manage. Each city tells the same story; streets choked with blackened skeletons and ground vehicles, burned-out towers jutting out of paved surface like broken, rotting teeth in the mouth of a dockside addict. Whatever happened to trigger a Final War here, it was sudden, violent, and completely indiscriminate.",
planet_lenze,CUSTOM,"An intense skipspace excursion event roughly 440Mya left Lenze an irradiated, deeply alien world, surfaced in roiling dimensional fractures and weirdly stressed, brane-artifacted terrain. Scientific debates rage about whether the unprecedented Sigma Event that remade Lenze was natural or artificial - a question with truly incredible implications.

The raw energy on display is equal parts tantalizing and threatening. Whatever happened here, it involved energy releases that dwarf all of the Sector�s combined conflicts to date.",,"Nothing about Lenze is any less unsettling from closer in - if anything, the planet's uncanny qualities are magnified by close proximity and more sensor data. Endless plains of glassy slag flicker with the pale blue light of skipspace excursions and the dull glow of trans-universal radiation.

Rad levels on the surface are truly staggering, and it�s hard to tell where the weather ends and plate tectonics begin.",
planet_marat,CUSTOM,"An icy, forbidding gas giant, Marat is a gorgeous sight, orbiting magisterially amid a swarm of frozen moons.",,,
planet_morningside,CUSTOM,"A barren, tide-locked cinder of a world, closely orbiting Martinique. The pitted rockscapes on the nightside are rumored to be favorite meeting points for smugglers and organ-leggers.",,"A cacophony of failed or failing beacons, set up at various times and for various purposes, dot the landscape with irregular, anemic pings, making the possibility of landing unusually complicated... ensuring that spacers in need of a little privacy will refresh the forest of dying antennae regularly.",
planet_odessa,CUSTOM,"A tempestuous ocean planet, dotted here and there by jagged windblown islands and tantalizing hints of alien life. Various proposals to establish outposts on Odessa are mooted regularly in Peremohy Highport's council chambers, but thus far none have come to fruition.",,"During the early settlement of the Nikolaev system, Odessa was earmarked for intensive aquaculture operations, but the Collapse put paid to any hopes of establishing a colony on such rough seas. Periodic orbital studies have identified herds of cetacean creatures whose complex behavior suggests a definite, though non-technological, sapience. Perhaps future generations of humanity will have the resources to attempt contact; for now, fragments of their ululating song and sonar mapping of likely spawning grounds will have to suffice.",
planet_pyla,CUSTOM,"A dusty rock with minimal value, Pyla orbits Gironde closely, coincidentally providing truly spectacular displays of auroral activity as the gas giant's magnetic field excites the thin atmosphere and conductive particles in the sand.",,"Passed over in the rush to colonize easier, more hospitable worlds, Pyla is still empty of permanent settlements, but a small number of illegal dune-skimmer rally races are held here biannually.",
planet_qarib,CUSTOM,"An empty world of no discernable value, windblown and desolate. Enormous dust storms scour the surface, smoothing the landscape into a variety of haunting, alien forms.",,"While Qarib has no resources worthy of the name, it's a point of convenience for smugglers and other marginal characters to set down and do deals that wouldn't survive the perfunctory scrutiny of even the most inept and boredom-ridden customs official. Some of the landing sites are scorched and pitted by the recent evidence of vigorous commercial disagreements between these enterprising folks.",

,,,,,
dcp_magellan_battlecruiser,SHIP,"Surpassingly ugly and equally effective; a battlecruiser design that foregoes all attempt at subtlety in favor of raw frontal firepower, built around a huge spinal fusion lance and backed up by an impressive array of ballistics and a single flight deck. These ships represent a new, aggressive engagement philosophy for the conservative, doctrinaire Magellan Fleet.",,,
dcp_magellan_battleship,SHIP,"Nothing more than a titanic slab of armor pocked by engine nozzles and weapons emplacements, these immense and terrible gun platforms are the Magellan Fleet's raison d'etre; the enormous triphammers meant to smash an enemy's battle-line into glowing clouds of slag, gas, and shoals of twisted metal fragments.",,,

dcp_magellan_cbtfreight,SHIP,"Simple, durable, both well-equipped and comparatively rare, these rugged combat freighters are heavier on the 'combat' side. While not the equal of dedicated patrol ships, woe betide the pirates who find themselves between the crossed arcs of her gun turrets.

Given the paucity of meaningful, or at least high-volume, multi-system commerce in Magellan space, it's more remarkable that a ship like this exists at all than that it's so well-found. The hardy few Magellan traders who could be called 'independent' are often a short step up from pirates themselves, legitimized only by their fast talking and much-thumbed letters of marque, as well as careful timing - never hitting a ship that can't be overlooked, and always ensuring that any goods pilfered are expertly fenced, or flawlessly appear to be legitimate salvage.",,,
dcp_magellan_cruiser,SHIP,"A solid and unimaginative line cruiser, this veteran design is essentially unchanged from the first models rushed out to defend the Khamn system during the first AI War. What it lacks in offensive firepower, it makes up for in sheer, stubborn ability to take punishment and a ruggedness that has kept many individual hulls flying well past the century mark.",,,
dcp_magellan_fastdestroyer,SHIP,"Unusual for a Magellan ship, a fast, mobile combatant with an emphasis on alpha strikes, sporting a fearsome armored prow for ramming. Captains are cautioned not to allow enemies around to the rear, as most weapons and the heaviest armor are oriented forward.",,,

dcp_magellan_lev_dronefrig,SHIP,"A simple and utterly disposable corvette, useful mainly as a screen for other vessels. The use of forbidden AI technology has made the Leveller movement a pariah in the Sector, and alienated many of the potential allies who could bolster their numbers - but allows the ship to be operated with a very small, or no, crew.",,,

dcp_magellan_lightcruiser,SHIP,"A fast light cruiser, newer than much of the Magellan Fleet but built to a well-balanced design, emphasizing long-range scouting and all-round defense. Production has increased markedly since the end of the second AI War, and is rapidly replacing older cruiser designs in Fleet service.",,,
dcp_magellan_linedestroyer,SHIP,"A simple, stolid brick of a ship, designed for nothing so much as outright brawling at short to medium ranges. More versatile slots than a typical Domain standard design.",,,
dcp_magellan_linefrigate,SHIP,"Somewhat undergunned for its size, but perfectly capable in a close fight.",,,
dcp_magellan_ltfreight,SHIP,"An entirely unimpressive light freighter, the bulk of independent Magellan commerce is carried in these durable hulls; better-protected than most, but scarcely cost-efficient.",,,
dcp_magellan_patroldestroyer,SHIP,"A newer, and above all longer-ranged, vessel than most of the Fleet's destroyers, the Kant class is equipped with a single fighter bay, top-flight sensor drones, and high-capacity fuel tanks. Lightly-built in comparison to a pure combat vessel, the Kant is designed for long-range scouting and anti-piracy duties - at which it, predictably, excels.",,,
dcp_magellan_phasecruiser,SHIP,"Not too far divergent from the first testbed phase-cloak platforms built by the Protectorate, this ungainly, lumpen cruiser is nevertheless a highly effective design in the right hands.",,,
dcp_magellan_phasefrig,SHIP,"A durable, tough phase frigate, notable mainly for the outsized bow mount.

One unusual feature of the Yeager is the modular internal structure; unlike typical phase ships, an enterprising captain could easily convert some of the missile storage spaces into room for extra crew...",,,
dcp_magellan_supply,SHIP,"Slow, bulky, heavily armored and largely defenseless; penal logistics crews have been a staple of Magellan Fleet doctrine for centuries, and this rugged supply ship has outlived several generations of the hapless malcontents who flew her.",,,
dcp_magellan_supportcruiser,SHIP,"A new-model combat cruiser, showing a certain amount of promise as a fleet-level support ship and artillery platform. An unusual asymmetric hull holds a monstrous missile installation, delivering heavy salvoes at long range.",,,
dcp_magellan_supportdestroyer,SHIP,"Tough, swift, and armed to the teeth; a mainstay of Magellan patrol operations and an iconic standard-bearer for the Fleet. The forward quadrant of these ships is a zone of death for anything smaller than another destroyer.",,,
dcp_magellan_supportfrigate,SHIP,"Tough and versatile, a frigate design for all seasons, equipped with an afterburning propulsion pack. Ideal for close pursuits and fleet picket duty.",,,
,,,,,
dcp_magellan_schooner,SHIP,"An antiquated, temperamental design, the Musa is either an elegant, timeless classic, or a clapped-out fuel-guzzling relic, depending on who you ask, the condition of the hull, and whether they've had to clean the notoriously fickle thruster-injection filters lately. Regardless, it's a tough and well-found little cargo ship; large for a frigate, decently armed, and remarkably agile.",,,
dcp_magellan_skiff,SHIP,"One of the rare civilian ships unique to Magellan space, this antiquated vessel is as well-armed as some patrol frigates in more secure regions.",,,
dcp_magellan_skipjack,SHIP,"Shrouded in myth and legend, the Mallory is a hull so antiquated, and yet so timeless, that nearly every starfarer for the last millenium could tell you the ship's name and reputation, but no two could agree on its original specifications or performance. Over the centuries, myriad variants were produced; the interior volume is highly configurable, and the internal flux frame is massively overbuilt.",,,

dcp_magellan_bonecracker,WEAPON,"A compact and terrifying fragmentation shotgun, flinging an explosive shell surrounded by a cloud of semi-molten debris that chews up damaged armor and unprotected hull. A simple target-tracking system allows it to be used as supplemental point defense.

While punishments for misuse of resources in the Fleet's lower ranks tend to the draconian and final, that doesn't stop tertiary-battery crews assigned to Bonecracker stations from setting up occasional unauthorized skeet-shooting matches, using scraps of rusted hull plating for targets. Many astute commanders look the other way; anything that improves gunnery performance can be forgiven, so long as there are no major accidents.",Assault,,

Because the bombs are externally-primed, they require flux to arm and fire.",Strike,,
dcp_magellan_largebonecrusher,WEAPON,"An ancient, devastating twin-mount heavy autocannon, firing enormous semi-molten bolts in linked salvos. The heavier bolts have excellent penetration, and allow even a single mount to chew through a substantial belt of armor.

While the single-mount Bonecrusher weapon is notoriously inaccurate, this twin turret is pleasantly stable, allowing for much more accurate fire. Turret crews also appreciate the protection afforded by the heavy iridium-composite cast armor.",Assault,,
dcp_magellan_largemortar,WEAPON,"An enormous, low-velocity artillery piece, firing a massive hellbore-type shell at long range. The detonation is so large it threatens not just the target, but nearby ships as well.",Fire Support,,

dcp_magellan_quenchcannon,WEAPON,"An advanced spinal-mount magnetic cannon, firing large hypervelocity slugs that stress shield generators and spall into deadly fragments behind armor. Due to the huge recoil and power requirements, this weapon must be integrated into the ship's frame to fire safely.",Close Support,,
dcp_magellan_quenchgun,WEAPON,"An advanced magnetic cannon, firing hypervelocity slugs that stress shield generators and spall into deadly fragments behind armor.

Unlike most Magellan weapons, Quench Guns are extremely accurate and fast, and predictably, their crews tend towards the upper end of both the social scale and the career track for gunnery. This is balanced out somewhat by the graphic accounts of what happens if a poorly-maintained solenoid coil should scrape the projectile on the way out of the barrel - typically disassembling the mount explosively, and turning the crew into chunky salsa as the fragments of their weapon spall back into the gunnery station.",Close Support,,

dcp_magellan_smgatling,WEAPON,"A light rotary autocannon, perfect for hammering an enemy shield with a constant stream of light kinetic shells.

Unlike more typical gatling cannons with fixed barrels, this weapon uses a carousel-type rotating cage to cycle the action, allowing the barrels to recoil individually. Consequently, it's shockingly accurate for a high-velocity autocannon.",Close Support,,

dcp_magellan_sniperautogun,WEAPON,"A light, accurate autocannon, perfect for straining an enemy shield with a steady stream of light kinetic shells.

While it has little else to recommend it, this weapon is popular for the simple fact that it allows smaller and weaker ships to contribute to a fight from the backline; many Magellan commanders also find that the weapon is useful in bulk on larger ships with abundant small mounts.",Close Support,,

Heavily-armed ocean platforms swirl around the surface as well, constantly tracking any nearby orbital ships deemed to be threats by a planet-wide network of sensors.",,"A shining blue marble around Magella's orange vastness, Annore is a world at once beautiful and forbidding; the spires of her ethereal ocean estates gleam bright, almost obscuring the long, questing muzzles of STO rocket-gun batteries that interrogate the heavens for outsider mischief. The good life is on display here; a rich, aristocratic tradition of plenty and sophistication by Sector standards. Mute personal servants and whimsical automatons scamper after every citizen's whim and fancy, and high technology invisibly secures a vast array of privileges for those honored to call themselves Citizens of Annore. The Protectorate's ruling class forms yet another tier of rarefied aristocratic power and status, above even the citizenry of this hermetic paradise.",
station_annoreorbital,CUSTOM,"A small station, by the standards of the wealth and privilege enjoyed by Annore's inhabitants; Annore Orbital is a surprisingly busy commercial starport, importing and exporting a huge volume of goods for the benefit of the planet below. Automated refining and manufacturing take place here, tastefully separated from Annore itself.",,"A combination of commercial starport and vast government structure, Annore Orbital is home to the twice-yearly Convocation, in which the leading families of Annore gather to divide the material spoils of a brutally pointed social pyramid. The bacchanal atmosphere suffuses the station the rest of the year round; a 'trip upstairs', as the locals call it, is almost always an occasion for debauchery and dissipated excess.",
planet_jeshad,CUSTOM,"Parched dry and crowded with semi-buried cities, Jeshad is a harsh planet, scoured by dust storms that can imperil the most hardened landing craft. The bulk of the Magellan population lives here, crammed into arcologies that ring the narrow livable belts around the poles where temperatures are bearable most of the day.",,"A desperately dry, overpopulated world, Jeshad is the manpower reserve that keeps the Magellan state afloat; recruits for the Fleet and the Protector's Army are levied on Jeshad, offering pay and benefits that seem munificent to the inhabitants of the crowded, parched hive-cities that ring the cooler poles. Nomadic raiders travel the great equatorial deserts, raiding outlying settlements and skirmishing with one another using everything from primitive chemical firearms to surprisingly modern energy weaponry. Each clan hews to no law but their own in the fleets of armored rovers they call home, while their punctiliousness in matters of honor and cut-throat competition for resources have made them both highly fractious and highly skilled. Attempts to recruit the desert nomads for the Fleet have been a mixed success; some of the greatest Magellan heroes and worst mutineers have hailed from the deep deserts of Jeshad.",
planet_magella,CUSTOM,"A sight to behold, and the dominant orbital body in the night skies of both Annore and Jeshad, the gas giant Magella orbits close around Khamn, glowing like a second sun from the reflected light.",,"Majestic and hazardous in equal measure, Magella is intensively mined for volatiles by a small flotilla of independent gas harvesters; every now and then, one of the ill-maintained, scrappy craft will plummet into the roiling cloudbanks in a shower of light and screaming metal.",
planet_pariya,CUSTOM,"Barren, but with ideal conditions for antimatter fuel production, Pariya hosts a small outpost around the primary fuel plant and several batteries of guns dedicated to protecting it.",,"The compact, spartan fuel production bases and outlying security outposts on Pariya's surface look and feel far more like a military outpost than a commercial endeavor; armed guards are everywhere, and especially alert at the (frequent) checkpoints.",
planet_turan,CUSTOM,"A temperate desert world verging on airless, Turan is home to both substantial heavy industry and a small agricultural colony, populated chiefly by Magellan dissidents and exiles.",,"Unlike the vastly less hospitable colony of Valca, the rift valleys and deeper craters of Turan are shirt-sleeve habitable by human beings, albeit with breath masks for anything longer than a quick hike. A competitive industrial sector and hardy farming domes ensure that the planetary government is merely subservient to the Magellan governing structure that dominates local space; interference in local affairs is rare, and the smarter locals work to keep it that way.",
station_turanstarport,CUSTOM,"A small customs port, mainly useful for maintining the defense platform that protects Turan from invasion.",,"This little port is vastly overshadowed by Meetpoint Turan, and spacers avoid docking here if possible in favor of the larger, more favorable station in higher orbit.",
planet_valca,CUSTOM,"Icy, foreboding, but nevertheless rich in volatiles, the Valca colony is technically independent of Magellan control, and serves a secondary purpose as a dumping ground for undesirables.",,"A frozen world with rich deposits of volatiles, Valca was colonized to supply the Fleet's new fuel production facilities and just as quickly became a hotbed of dissent; the solution was to declare the planet nominally independent, and lock the new government into a highly favorable contract for volatile supply. Port controls and the station in orbit keep trouble that brews on the surface contained there, while poverty and the harsh surface conditions impose their own kind of order on any exiles looking to return home at the head of a revolution.",
station_valcabastion,CUSTOM,"A substantial military outpost, designed mainly to contain the restive populations of Valca and Turan, as well as ensure the volatile supply to Pariya's new fuel facility.",,"The garrison here is well-paid, but has relatively few options for off-shift activities; predictably, there's a thriving culture of heavy binge-drinking and petty violence in addition to the usual run of officially-sanctioned leisure.",
station_meetpoint,CUSTOM,"An obsolete and somewhat decrepit starport, repurposed as the headquarters of the local free-mercantile association.",,"While Magellan space could hardly be called a commercial paradise, what trade in the local volume of space that can be called independent is headquartered here - a ramshackle, swapmeet-freeport where every ship's deck is a law unto itself and no sensible spacer gets between two crews with a grudge. Captains who dock here are notorious for accepting little to no restraint on their trade, their movements, and their much-touted customary rights to refuse inspection, declaration, or taxation on their cargoes. Many are little better than pirates, given half an opportunity and a halfway-plausible letter of marque or 'militia' licensure, and much of the trade that goes through here is as much about goods fenced as goods exchanged.",
planet_driftersrest,CUSTOM,"Desolate and unremarkable, the local pirates and criminal gangs have established a small swapmeet port on this otherwise useless world.",,"Almost nothing about this planetesimal is in any way remarkable; it's purely interesting due to the dug-in pirate base that sits under thick layers of compacted regolith and metalloceramic armor. In spite, rather than because, of this excessive dedication to protection, the locals are more paranoid that usual; fears of a strike on unprotected domes by the Fleet or a local militia are supplanted or augmented by fears of internal power struggles to control a desirable base of operations.",
planet_spera,CUSTOM,"A desolate, frozen rock with little to offer, Spera was a Fleet-run penal colony reserved for the most dangerous political criminals. When Port Obilo mutinied, the Spera prison camp fell into revolt, and the surface facility was abandoned.",,"The base here was mainly constructed of pressurized fabric anti-rad domes, supported by flexible aluminum girders; little of either survived the revolt. A few twisted scraps of metal and desiccated plasticloth are all that remain near the sputtering landing beacon.",
dcp_magellan_fleet_sporeship,CUSTOM,"An abandoned sporeship hulk, very likely one of the original Fleet that carried the Magellan people to this system. It's been taken over as an ad-hoc headquarters by the Blackcollar Regiment.",,"The bones of this hulk have been picked clean by the Fleet's penal salvage crews several times over, and yet, the ruined craft remains a vast and impressive edifice, majestic with age and use in a way that few human objects can match - a fitting headquarters for the most feared soldiers in Magellan space. A great deal of the volume is sealed off from access by outsiders, but this small and functional concourse has a reception area for any traders or supply-ship captains who may need to cool their heels before heading back out.",
dcp_magellan_levellerbase,CUSTOM,"A ramshackle, makeshift space station, displaying no signs of recent occupation. Massive damage is evident all over the structure.",,"In the aftermath of the first, disastrous Leveller Uprising on Jeshad, a bare handful of intrepid souls managed to flee the Khamn system and eke out a living in the asteroid belts here. The colony ultimately proved nonviable, but before it could fail completely, a punitive expedition arrived from Khamn. There were no survivors, and the station has remained silent ever since.",
planet_calicheman,CUSTOM,"A dusty world of cattle ranching and extreme corruption, Calicheman is an anarchic freeport more or less by accident. Few ships touch down here with legitimate business, but all are welcome.",,"Too poor and too marginal to justify the returns, Calicheman has never been worth bringing under any kind of central control; neither the Magellan Protectorate nor any organized independent government or corporation can profitably control the planet, and so far none have been unwise enough to try. This suits the prickly locals just fine; few enough of them care about the wider galaxy unless it has something to trade for hides and jerky.",
dcp_station_junkyardstarport,CUSTOM,"Part scrapyard, part fortress, this half-destroyed hulk was formerly a mining base in the inner system, but has been refitted as a de facto headquarters for several of the local salvage organizations and crime syndicates.",,"Already marginal when the easy pickings of the local belt were exhausted, this once-promising mining facility in the inner system fell to a revolt and was swiftly abandoned to its fate by a Fleet that had no need of the meager trickle of resources it was by then bringing in. In a brief fit of high-minded moralism, it was renamed Ghammol Station after an outback town razed by the Blackcollars during the first Leveller Uprising.",
station_obilotbase,CUSTOM,"Once an outer system early-warning post, Port Obilo fell to mutiny during a series of upheavals on Jeshad, coordinated with a general rebellion in the Fleet's patrol forces. Now, it's the locus of most illegal activity in the system; whatever your darkest desire, it can be found here.",,"Every society has an underbelly, and Magellan society has more than most; Port Obilo's ramshackle concourses house everything from the most incorrigible career criminals to naive Leveller revolutionaries. All the inhabitants really have in common is their inability to make lives for themselves on either Annore or Jeshad, and fights are common, but they're in agreement on one point; the station batteries and minefields that keep the Fleet at bay must be maintained, whatever the cost.",
magellan_protectorate,FACTION,"A militaristic, closed society, founded before the recorded settlement of the Persean Sector by an STL fleet of refugees from a rebellion against the Domain of Man. Harried by Domain drone weaponry and trapped in their aging early-model sporeships, the Fleet that would become the Magellan Protectorate developed a rigid and brutal caste system that persists to the present, as well as a rough-edged, and inward-turned, culture.

Deeply suspicious of outsiders and equipped with a unique technological heritage based on long-obsolescent Domain hardware, the Magellan Protectorate has held its own against the rest of the Sector's inhabitants... so far.",,,
magellan_theherd,FACTION,"Lusty, violent, and above all radioactive; the pirate gang known as The Herd hails from the marginal steppe world of Calicheman, and has plagued Magellan space since regular commercial travel between the systems of the cluster became practical. While unpredictable and terrifying to civilian traders, their ramshackle and poorly-maintained vessels are no match for the mighty battle-line of the Magellan Fleet.",,,
magellan_leveller,FACTION,"A radical egalitarian movement within Magellan society, the Levellers are a small but vocal minority party, often banned outright under more repressive High Protectors, with an energetic armed wing; ever-ready to strike against the forces of the state - often with little to no regard for innocent bystanders. No act is too extreme in pursuit of their ideal society, and nothing less than complete abolition of social class and unequal treatment before the law will satisfy the Levellers.",,,
