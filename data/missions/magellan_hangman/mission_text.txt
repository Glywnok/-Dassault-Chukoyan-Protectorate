A motley group of pirates known as the Herd have entered into a profitable deal with a corrupt quartermaster on Valca Bastion. Local forces have been paid off, and some have struck their banners openly for the Herd's leaders with the tacit backing of the garrison commander, an odious little weasel by the name of Maxau who brings disgrace to his family name.

As the on-site Blackcollar commander, you have orders to crush these marauders and bring their depredations on the supply line of volatiles from Valca to a swift end. Your more private instructions from the prestigious Sxown family indicate that the messy death of their wayward scion, on board the command carrier for a meeting with the Herdmaster, would not be unwelcome.

Political assassinations aren't something the elite Blackcollars are would lower themselves to, of course.

But spacers would. And hangmen.
