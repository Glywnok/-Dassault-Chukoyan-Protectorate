Skytiger officers are born among Annore’s elite, or raised to the peerage as an easy method of ensuring their loyalty, and they have attitudes to match; most care little more for the common spacers of their fleets than for the starvelings they gun down for their masters. This massively fortified building serves as a center for the recruitment, training, and command of the elite guard divisions that patrol Annore's local space.",2650,EXTREME
