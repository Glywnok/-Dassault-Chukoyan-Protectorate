AddText ""The interior of the ancient sporeship has been cleaned, but otherwise retains the wear and patina of age that lends it more solemn dignity than any decoration could hope for. These aren't precisely hallowed grounds, but they resist trivialization - and decorating the site of generations-long desperation to escape the clutches of the Domain is surely that, a trivialization of what was sacrificed, and survived, to bring the Fleet here. You get the sense that civilians are distinctly unwelcome, but you're treated with a brusque, functional courtesy by everyone you interact with.""

Every death is memorialized; no distinction of gender, ethnicity, rank, or class is made, no mention of how honorable or craven a death may have been. They are simply recorded, laser-etched into the memorial in order as they fall by pitiless automated scribes, and indexed so that the heads-up displays of any visitor can pick out a name if so requested.

You leave after a while, uncomfortable in the presence of so much death, with so little context.","dcp_blackcollarBaseLeave:Leave","Visit Dialogue"

Inside, one wall of the vast space has been decorated with paper and imitation-silk flowers, predominantly purple or red. Around and among the flowers, sometimes layers deep, have been placed a variety of 2D and 3D images, short holos, news-flimsy sheets, smart-paper sheets, and small screens. Each activates as you pass near enough to it to trigger a sensor; you see pictures of young men and women cradling carbines, news articles, poetry, proclamations, speeches… and glimpses, though only briefly, of the chaotic, bloody ruck of the first Leveller Uprising show through. Little to none of the memorial references the station itself; a few brief notes seem to be related to the construction of the habitat, but nothing else.

The Uprising may have been defeated, but no movement that can inspire such a memorial can be said to have been beaten. And certainly the pressures that created the Levellers still exist in Magellan society…","dcp_oldLevellerHabitatLeave:Leave","Visit Dialogue"

AddText ""Meetpoint Turan is owned by the Guild of Free Traders, run by a stationmaster elected at their bi-yearly conclave, and it's one of the few ports where the common spacer is treated like he owns the place - as he in fact does, part-share, as long as his dues are paid. The sleepovers are clean, the bars don't water their drinks, and the station police are unarmed and deferential - a major and welcome change from other ports in Magellan space.""

They refuse to hear your protests to the contrary and beckon you over to share in food, chatter, and several swigs out of an unlabelled bottle.

...There once was a ship that plied the stars,
And the name of the ship was the Lily of Mars,
The hyper storms ripped her up and down,
Take hold, ye spacers, take hold...

...Soon may the salvageman come,
To bring us drugs and organs and guns,
One day, when the scavenging’s done,
We’ll take our leave and go.

After a few more raucous songs and far too many voices imploring you to stay for 'just one more drink!', you bid your hosts farewell and wander back to your ship's berth, belly warm with the rough liquor and with new, happy memories.","dcp_meetpointLeave:Leave","Visit Dialogue"
